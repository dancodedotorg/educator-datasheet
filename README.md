## MOTIVATION
- **For what purpose was the _original_ dataset created?**
- **For what purpose was the _derived_ dataset created?**
- **Who created the _original_ dataset (e.g., which company, team, research group, etc.)?**
- **Who created the _derived_ dataset (e.g., which company, team, research group, etc.)?**
- **Who funded the creation of the _original_ dataset?**
- **Who funded the creation of the _derived_ dataset?**

## COMPOSITION
- **What does a row in the dataset represent?**
- **How many rows are in the dataset, in total?**
- **Does the dataset contain all possible rows or is it a sample of rows from a larger set?**
- **If it’s a sample, describe your sampling process (random, weighted, etc). Is the sample representative of the larger set (e.g., geographic coverage)?**

## DERIVATION PROCESS
- **Who was involved in the data derivation process (e.g., students, crowdworkers, contractors) and how were they compensated (e.g., how much were crowdworkers paid)?**
- **What processes (e.g., cleaning, filtering, labeling) did the derivation process perform?**
- **If software was used to perform the derivation, is it available? If so, please provide a link or other access point:**
- **What information was removed or transformed during derivation that might influence the findings of an analysis (e.g., deleting rows due to missing data, a sampling mechanism that over-samples from a particular group, etc.)?**

## USES
- **Are there real-world applications of the dataset that an educator should be aware of?**

## EDUCATOR'S GUIDE
- **Are there recommended subsets to be explored?**
- **Are there outliers or unusual observations to be pointed out?**
- **Are there any correlations in the derivative dataset to be pointed out?**
- **Does the data embody any computing or statistical learning goals (e.g., columns have a particular skew, correlations demonstrate Simpson’s Paradox, etc.)?**
- **What potential threats to validity would be worth discussing?**
